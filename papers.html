<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>Roaming payment protocols are generally implemented by public key interface (PKI). In our approach, the home agent (HA) can delegate the signing ability to a user, and the signed messages are therefore can be verified directly by HA's public key. Due to the delegation-based authentication, the foreign agent can validate the communication without needing to reveal the real identity of the mobile user.</p>
<p>We add a payment functionality to delegagion-based roaming protocol. By leveraging the blind signature technique, our approach can provide unlinkability between mobile devices and service providers.</p>
<p>However, the ability to discover the malicious user's identification is still remained. Home agents can detect the misbehavior and identify the mobile user if somebody doubly spends the e-cash in roaming.</p>

<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>With the rapid growth of network attacks and vulnerabilities, mulware detection and prevention are increasingly important. Especially in large-scale cloud computing environment, the administrator can not inspect each virtual machine and find the system's weak point. Therefore, how to develop an automated analysis tool has become a popular issue.</p>
<p>Network attacks could result from the errors of system settings, or design mistakes (exploits). We use MulVAL to scan the system's vulnerabilities and draw an attack graph (AG), which shows the routes of network attacks. Since every route represents a strategy to compromise the victim, administrators can fix those weak points in the AG to minimize the chance for servers to be exploited.</p>
<p>Moreover, Snort, a well-known intrusion detection system (IDS), will monitor the packets going through the router, and with user-defined rules, Snort fires alerts if the packet has any malicious content inside.</p>
<p>In the first type of our IDS, we map alerts to the AG to visualize the actions of network attacks. Administrators can know the process of the current attack by the depth of corresponding node, and defense multi-hop attacks since we can preview which strategy is taken by the attacker.</p>
<p>The second type is alert correlating. For those alerts failed to match the AG, we analyze their context and draw correlation graphs to show the potential attack strategies.</p>
